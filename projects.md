establish trust in forms of treatment and monitoring that involve telecare, the
use of technology at home in interaction with online systems. Furthermore, the
project aims to evaluate when this trust is well-grounded, and to develop
guidelines for the responsible deployment and further innovation of telecare
services with an eye on promoting reasonable patient trust, autonomy, and
self-management (2013-2014).


### [Vrijewil.info](http://vrijewil.info)

was used for the Philosophy central exam in Dutch high schools.
