## Active projects

### [Redesigning Psychiatry](http://www.redesigningpsychiatry.org/) ([dutch](http://www.redesigningpsychiatry.org/), [english](https://www.reframingstudio.com/projects/reframing-mental-health))

This research through design programme aims to change mental health care in the Netherlands at multiple
levels, including everyday use of clinical language, the concepts and methods
used for research and diagnosis, and the design of technologies and built
environments.


### [Channels](https://github.com/sandervoerman/channels)

A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) package providing iterator streams
between coroutines with async/await syntax. The paradigm resembles channels in
[Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2) and [CSP](http://www.usingcsp.com/),
but the implementation uses generators and asyncio to keep everything
lightweight and pythonic. Version 0.4 is
[available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sav.channels/).
Version 1.0, which will have a slightly different API, is under development.



## Past projects

### [Jesuis](https://github.com/sandervoerman/jesuis)

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for profile websites, written
in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (2019). It is used on this website.


### HIC vision and concept for GGZ Drenthe

GGZ Noord-Holland-Noord, the Netherlands (2017-2018).


### [Medical Trust Beyond Clinical Walls](http://beyondclinicalwalls.nl/)

The purpose of this project is to investigate how patients with chronic diseases
establish trust in forms of treatment and monitoring that involve telecare, the
use of technology at home in interaction with online systems. Furthermore, the
project aims to evaluate when this trust is well-grounded, and to develop
guidelines for the responsible deployment and further innovation of telecare
services with an eye on promoting reasonable patient trust, autonomy, and
self-management (2013-2014).


### [Vrijewil.info](http://vrijewil.info)

A companion website for high school teachers and students during 2011-2015,
when our textbook,
[*Vrije wil*](https://www.lemniscaat.nl/boeken/vrije-wil-discussies-over-verantwoordelijkheid-zelfverwerkelijking-en-bewustzijn/),
was used for the Philosophy central exam in Dutch high schools.
