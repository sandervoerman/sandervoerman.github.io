I am a philosopher and developer working in the fields of mental health, ethics,
and information technology. I work at
[Parnassia Groep](https://www.parnassiagroep.nl/) and
[Redesigning Psychiatry](http://www.redesigningpsychiatry.org/).

I have lectured at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/),
[Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/) and
[Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/),
and I have published on a wide range of philosophical topics, most of which have
something to do with the problem of understanding human agency.
