I am a philosopher and developer working in the fields of mental health, ethics,
and information technology. I work at
[Parnassia Groep](https://www.parnassiagroep.nl/) within the
[MRC Research Center](https://mrcresearch.nl/person/sander-voerman/).
I am affiliated with [VU University](https://www.vu.nl/) and a member of the
[Redesigning Psychiatry](http://www.redesigningpsychiatry.org/) programme.

I have lectured at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/),
[Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/) and
[Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/),
and I have published on a number of philosophical topics, most of which have
something to do with the problem of understanding human agency.
